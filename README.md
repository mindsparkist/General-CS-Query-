What Is a daemon is Operating systems or in CS terms 

In the context of operating systems, a "daemon" (pronounced dee-mun) is a background process that runs without direct interaction with the user. Daemons are typically responsible for performing various system tasks or providing services, such as managing hardware devices, handling network requests, or performing scheduled maintenance.

Background Process: Daemons run in the background, detached from the terminal or user interface. They don't require user intervention to operate.

No User Interface: Unlike regular applications with graphical user interfaces (GUI) or command-line interfaces (CLI), daemons usually operate silently without any direct user interaction.

System Services: Daemons often provide essential system services, such as printing, file serving, or network services. Examples include the Apache web server daemon (httpd), the sshd daemon for secure shell access, or the cron daemon for scheduling tasks.

Long-Running: Daemons typically run continuously, waiting for events or requests to trigger their actions. They're designed to persistently serve the system or respond to specific conditions.

Initiated at Boot: Many daemons are started automatically when the operating system boots up. They continue to run until the system shuts down.

Configurable: Daemons are often configurable through configuration files, allowing system administrators to customize their behavior.
